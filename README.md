# Debbie the Decibel Robot
https://github.com/bananabrann/debbie
The mission is build a simple robot that measures the surrounding sounds and displays a decibel level.
* Has an Arduino Uno as the microprocessor.
* Be typed in primarily C++ in Xcode.
* Does not have any motors or moving parts/peripherals.

## Background Research
Four companies that use the same technologies/languages used in this idea.
1. Thermo Fisher Scientific and every company in the Biomedical and Life Sciences.
1. Bethesda Games, or any video game company.

### 🥉Bronze Medal, MVP
(Minimum Viable Product) For the minimum requirement, the robot will...

- [x] be named Decibel Debbie.
- [ ] be completely self-sustaining --not hooked to a computer.
- [ ] use an external microphone to detect sound, then ↓...
- [ ] successfully display the decibels on a 7-segment LED display.

### 🥈Silver Medal
After reaching MVP, it would be nice if Debbie ...

- [ ] Display a little graph, or colored lights that correspond with the receiving decibels.
- [ ]  has an external shell protecting her inner bits.

### 🥇Gold Medal
For final state of Debbie, Debbie will...
- [ ] will have a protective external shell to guard her inner bits.
- [ ] have an additional display that displays the text of sounds of a similar decibel level that is currently being picked up. E.g., displayed "vacuum cleaner" when the decibel level is between 75 to 85 dB.

### The Plan
1. Research Arduino/C++ language, learn the basics on the framework of Arduino's C++.
1. Test interface from computer to board by developing a test program that displays and activates a light on the Arduino.
1. Build prototype of Debbie.
