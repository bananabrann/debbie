# C'ing the Light
In this readme, I will define what the MVP and Gold Medal goals are, as well as adding the things that I have learned about C in the order that was learned.

# The Goal
The mission is build a simple robot that measures the surronding sounds and displays a decibel level. The robot will...
* ... be named Decibel Debbie.
* ... be completely self-sustaining --not hooked to a computer.
* ... have the motherboard be an Arduiono Uno.
* ... not have any moving motors or peripherals.
* ... use an external microphone to detect sound.
* ... display the decibels on a 7-segment LED display.

### MVP
(Most Viable Product)
At the minimum, Debbie should ...
- [ ] ... successfully read the decibel level.
- [ ] ... successfully display the decibel level.

### Gold Medal
After reaching MVP, it would be nice if Debbie ...
- [ ] ... had an additional display where it displays the text of sounds of a similar decibel level that is currently being picked up. E.g., displayed "vacuum clearner" when the decibel level is between 75 to 85 dB.
- [ ] ... displayed a brief greeting when first booting.
- [ ] ... had an external shell protecting her inner bits.

# What I Learned About C
For General Assembly teach yourself day, my focus is to understand the basic syntax of C for project 4'. I plan on building a simple robot that will "listen" to the surronding area, and display its decibel level.
